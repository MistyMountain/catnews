## But... I'm not using Chrome!

That's fine. You just have different instructions.

1. Fork this repo.
2. Go to [geojson.io](http://geojson.io).
3. In the top right corner, click login. If it says your GitHub username and there's an option to logout, you are obviously logged in.
4. At the top of the page, click Open.
5. Click the GitHub tab in the area on the right.
6. Click through until you get to catnews.geojson.
7. Follow instructions above starting at step 5.

## Questions / Comments / Feedback

Bring it on! Make a pull request! Open an issue! I am particularly crappy at design, so if anyone wants to make it look pretty, go ahead. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub's functionality and wish to email me directly, I'm lyzi@codeforamerica.org or [@lyzidiamond](http://twitter.com/lyzidiamond) on Twitter.
